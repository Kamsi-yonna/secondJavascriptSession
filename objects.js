//each key has its value. Yonna is the object and it has 5 properties which each have their values/keys.
//Objects are fundamental. The one above is the object literal syntax.

//We should use arrays for ordered data and objects for less ordered data.
//Arrays can  be accessed with numbers/index
//objects cannot be accessed and the way they are listed in the code, does not really matter
